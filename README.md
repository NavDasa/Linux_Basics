# Linux_Basics
Complete understanding of Linux base for a DevOps Engineer 

                              Hardware <----> Operating systems <----> Software

  In order to communicate Hardware with Software we need an Operating systems, this is for Example Linux O.S, Windows O.S etc ..

  So this Linux O.S has a different distributions like Redhat Linux O.S, Ubuntu Linux O.S, Fedora Linux O.S. Everything are the distributions of Linux O.S

  Note: If you have any problem with Redhat Linux O.S, if you call the Ubuntu Linux O.S They won't slove your problem. Only which distribution version that you are using if you call that they will slove the problem and your issue.

OPENSOURCE: 

  Note : Many people say open source is for free. That's not the right word to speak, The right way of opensource defination is below.

  Open source mean many companies like mysql, Dynomodb, amazon, gives the opensource software to view there source code for free, but not to modify that source code. If you wan't to do there will be an Licencing aggrement, Maintence contract, Expensive while we using this in the production level.

THE SHELL: 

  Means intracts with Operating system that we can intract with. Either in Server U.I, or G.U.I.
  
  In linux we have Line User Interface. Shell is a screen to intract with Operating systems.
  
USERS:

  ROOT USER: Highest level of the Operating system, where our Opearating system is stored.

  USER's : where we have the Home folder that we can store, download pictures, videos etc ..

Capitalization:

  In windows : Home, home, HOME, homE in all the cases it works. Capitalization doesn't matters.

  In Linux O.S: HOME,home, Home, homE here it won't work, becausee Capitalization matters.


SERVER Vs DESKTOP:

  For Example in Linux O.S we have a Distribution of Redhat Linux O.S, this Redhat Linux O.S has two distributions like Server version, Desktop version.

  In the server distribution version we can only see terminal.

  In the Desktop version we can see everything.

Why Linux ?

  Because its has a secure in terms of servers, we have many opensource versions, we have a highest level of ROOT user for security, download an install any thing like utilites etc ..
